<!-- Step 5.3
  Divs are one of the most common HTML elements. Though our current styling is nice,
  if you be annoying if every div on every website had the same, fun styling. 
  Thankfully, divs don't naturally look like what they do here. So how does our div
  get it's style? Find out! Then see if you can remove that styling.

  Now, put the syling back. You might also notice there's a ton of space in our div 
  that isn't being used. Can you get rid of that space?

  Now things look awkward. They might look less awkward if we center our div on the page. 
  Try that!

  You might find that with CSS there's always many ways to achieve a single goal. 
  This can make CSS either easy or hard. If you ever get stuck between two different ways
  of doing something, I recommend just picking one way and moving on! You can always
  move over to the other way later on, if you need to :)
