<!-- Step 6: Exporting! -->
<!-- Step 6.0

  Great, so now we've a website that we can "dynamically" change! How cool is that?

  Our end goal is to enable the user to copy over some data which represents the
  generated email newsletter. In this part, we'll be addressing that.

  You'll want to start by copying over your step5.js into step6.js as well as your
  step5.html into here!

-->

<!-- Step 6.1
  Add another button labeled "generate html." This button will be used to generate text
  that represents the html that represents the newsletter display that our website 
  creates.

  Come up with some descriptive Javascript function name for this button's onclick to call
  and then head on over to step6.js to implement that function!
-->

<!-- 
  this stuff below is for the example() function. 
  Once you feel like you understand that function, feel free to delete it! 
-->
<script src="step6.js"></script>

<div id="example_input">
  <h1>Hello world!</h1>
  <p>How are you doing?</p>
</div>

<button onclick="example()">Generate Example Output!</button>

<textarea id="example_output"></textarea>
