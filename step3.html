  Step 3.0

  To get started here, you could copy and paste the path back into your browser's
  url bar, just like in part 1 & 2. Alternatively, you could try editing part2's url
  that's already in your browser window! Change the "step2.html" at the end to a 
  "step3.html"

<!--
  Step 3.1

  You might notice that the website's title is gold. Why is that?
  You won't find any CSS in this file--so how is it possible for the text to be styled?
-->
<h1 id="the_title">So you wanna set up a Stanford Daily email newsletter?</h1>

<!--
  Step 3.2
  hmm... step3.css looks awfully like a file. Wait--it is! Open up step3.css
  You can do this by checking the left side bar, or by pressing cmd+p and then 
  searching for "step3.css" (without the quotes)
-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="step3.css">
