<!-- Comments aren't "code"--when your computer "runs" a program, it ignores comments, as if they don't exist! -->

  Step 1.0

  get the "path" to this file

<!-- 
  Step 1.1

  Try changing the text between the <h1> and </h1> down below! Then, go to your browser window and click refresh. What happens?

  What are <h1> and </h1>? What if we replace them with something different? What happens if we remove one or both? Try it out!
