<!-- Step 2: Getting started, but with style... #swag -->

<!-- 
  Step 2.0

  To get started here, you're going to want to copy this file's path into your
  browser's url bar (refer to step1.html for instructions on how to do so)
-->

<!--
  Step 2.1

  What's different about the below line from step1.html?
  What is id? What if we change it to "the_real_title"? 
  Change "the_real_title" back to "the_title" after you're done
-->
<h1 id="the_title">So you wanna set up a Stanford Daily email newsletter?</h1>

<!--
  Step 2.2

  Congrats, you've discovered a new Tag! Style! And I must say, we never go out of it.

  You might notice that "the_title" and "the_real_title" appear below, just as they did 
  above. Just a coincidence? Nope! Try changing "the_title" to "not_the_title" down below.
  What happens? Then, change "the_title" to "not_the_title" up on the id of the h1 tag. Then what happens?
  Write comment about your findings!

  What are "padding-left" or "color" or "font-size"? What are the the "10px" or "firebrick" that go to
  their right?

  What is a "#the_title" or a "#the_real_title"?

<style type="text/css">
  #the_title {
      padding-left: 10px;
      color: firebrick;
  }
  #the_real_title {
      font-size: 100px;
      color: aquamarine;
  }
</style>

  Step 2.3

  Now, create a new id selector to style our h1 element. To start, you can try
  making the text center aligned. Then, feel free to get creative! Show off your
  artistic genius!
